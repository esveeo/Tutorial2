<p><h2>Biography</h2></p>

	
	<p>My name is Thierry Florvilus and I’m in the Digital Media major with a focus in game design. I’m currently pursuing various creative influences like writing books, digital art, animation, and video creation. A career I am considering is becoming a videogame designer. I haven’t won any major awards or made any huge projects like games but I am in the process of editing and revising my first novel and look to have it published in the near future. With my degree, I plan on trying to work my way into a job at big companies like EA, Ubisoft, or 2k. I also would like to get into film production or animation so I can bring my stories to life and get them out into the world for millions to enjoy.

	<p>One of my creative influences is Whyt Manga, a digital artist who’s tutorials taught me the basics of how to draw in the anime/manga style. Whyt Manga helped me take major strides in my art and I really respect him and his style which is why I want to try and emulate him.</p>

	<p>Another one of my creative influences is another digital artist by the name of Kuzomari. Kuzomari’s art style caught my eye while I was still learning the basics of drawing in the anime/manga style. I think his style is super cool and that’s why I want to emulate him.</p>

	<p>The last one of my creative influences is another digital artist by the name of Samdoesarts. Sam’s art style caught my eye while I was still learning the basics of drawing in the anime/manga style. I think his style is super cool and that’s why I want to emulate him.</p>
